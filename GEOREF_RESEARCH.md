# Georeferencing Research: "Blacks in the Colonial Bronx" 1750 Map

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Provide precise modern lat/lng coordinates for georeferencing the 1750 colonial Bronx map onto Google Maps using the Phase 1 georeferencing tool.

## Overview of the 1750 Map

The map titled "BLACKS IN THE COLONIAL BRONX" shows the entire Bronx area as it was divided in the colonial era, with five major land divisions:

1. **Manor of Philipsburgh** -- northwest
2. **Town of Eastchester** -- north-center
3. **Manor of Pelham** -- northeast (with coastline/peninsula)
4. **Manor of Fordham** -- center-west
5. **Manor of Morrisania** -- southwest

Visible waterways: Bronx River (running roughly north-south through the center), East River / Harlem River (western/southern border), Long Island Sound (eastern coastline). Several peninsulas are visible on the southern/eastern coast: Hunts Point, Clason Point, and Throgs Neck. Islands visible to the northeast (City Island area).

## C. Key Waterways and Modern Positions

### Bronx River
- **Path:** Runs north-to-south through the center of the Bronx. This is the CENTRAL DIVIDING LINE on the 1750 map, separating Philipsburgh/Fordham/Morrisania (west) from Eastchester/Pelham (east).
- **Northern entry to Bronx:** ~40.898, -73.867 (Woodlawn/Mt Vernon border)
- **At Fordham Road crossing:** ~40.862, -73.878
- **At Bronx Zoo area:** ~40.851, -73.879
- **Mouth (at East River):** ~40.808, -73.858 (between Hunts Point and Clason Point)

### Harlem River (Western border)
- **Northern start (Spuyten Duyvil):** 40.875, -73.918
- **At High Bridge:** 40.842, -73.930
- **At 3rd Avenue Bridge:** 40.818, -73.929
- **SW corner (Mott Haven):** 40.808, -73.926
- The Harlem River defines the entire western and southwestern border of the Bronx on the 1750 map.

### East River / Long Island Sound (Southern/Eastern border)
- The southern coast runs from Mott Haven (~40.808, -73.926) east past Hunts Point, Clason Point, and eventually to Throgs Neck (~40.805, -73.795)
- The eastern coast continues north along Long Island Sound past City Island to Pelham Bay

### Hutchinson River
- **Path:** Enters the Bronx from Pelham Manor (Westchester) in the northeast, flows south roughly parallel to and east of the Bronx River
- **Approximate entry point:** ~40.870, -73.822
- **Mouth (at Eastchester Bay):** ~40.828, -73.822
- On the 1750 map, this may be partially visible as the eastern boundary feature near the Pelham/Eastchester border

### Westchester Creek
- **Path:** Tidal inlet flowing south from Westchester Avenue area to the East River
- **Mouth coordinates:** 40.806, -73.842
- Parallels the Hutchinson River Parkway
- On the 1750 map, this creek runs between Clason Point and Throgs Neck

## D. Recommended Bounding Box for the 1750 Map

Based on the visible features on the map (the northern Yonkers/Westchester border, the western Harlem River coast, the southern East River coast, and the eastern Throgs Neck / City Island area), the optimal bounding box is:

### Precise 4-Corner Coordinates for Georeferencing

```
NORTHWEST CORNER:  40.910000, -73.933000
  (Just above the Riverdale/Yonkers border, west of Hudson River shore)

NORTHEAST CORNER:  40.910000, -73.762000
  (Above City Island / Hart Island, capturing the full NE extent of Pelham)

SOUTHEAST CORNER:  40.796000, -73.762000
  (South of Throgs Neck tip, capturing the full southern coastline including
   water area south of the peninsulas)

SOUTHWEST CORNER:  40.796000, -73.933000
  (South of Mott Haven along the Harlem River / East River junction)
```

### Why These Coordinates

- **North (40.910):** The map shows land extending to the Yonkers/Westchester border. Woodlawn is at ~40.898, and the map has a small margin of white space above the land.
- **South (40.796):** The map shows water below the peninsulas. Throgs Neck tip is at 40.805 and Clason Point at 40.806. The map image has significant water/blank area below the coast.
- **West (-73.933):** The Harlem River curves along the western edge. The westernmost river bend is near -73.930. Small margin included.
- **East (-73.762):** The map shows Hart Island and City Island. Hart Island center is at -73.769. Need margin east of the islands.

### For the Georeferencing Tool (index.html)

When Moya opens the tool, she should set the 4 corner handles to approximately:

| Corner | Latitude | Longitude |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **NW** | 40.910000 | -73.933000 |
| **NE** | 40.910000 | -73.762000 |
| **SE** | 40.796000 | -73.762000 |
| **SW** | 40.796000 | -73.933000 |

Then fine-tune by:
1. Setting opacity to ~50%
2. Matching **Throgs Neck peninsula tip** on the 1750 map to 40.805, -73.795 on Google Maps
3. Matching **Spuyten Duyvil** (NW coast bend) to 40.875, -73.918
4. Matching the **Bronx River mouth** (between Hunts Point and Clason Point) to 40.808, -73.858
5. Matching the **northern border line** to ~40.898 latitude

## E. Visual Alignment Guide

### Most Distinctive Features for Alignment (in priority order)

1. **Throgs Neck peninsula** -- The most distinctive shape. The long peninsula pointing SE is unmistakable. Align its tip to 40.805, -73.795.

2. **Bronx River path** -- The clear river running N-S through the center of the map. Its mouth should align with ~40.808, -73.858 and it should follow the modern Bronx River Parkway corridor north.

3. **Harlem River western coastline** -- The concave western border of the map. Should follow the modern Harlem River from Spuyten Duyvil (40.875, -73.918) south to Mott Haven (40.808, -73.926).

4. **Southern coastline shape** -- The scalloped coastline with Hunts Point and Clason Point peninsulas. Match the indentations.

5. **City Island** -- The elongated island in the NE. Should sit around 40.847, -73.786.

6. **Manor boundary lines** -- The internal boundary lines between manors should roughly correspond to modern neighborhood boundaries as described in Section B.

---

## F. Caveats and Limitations

1. **The 1750 map is hand-drawn** and not to precise cartographic standards. Internal distortions are inevitable. A 4-corner projective transform can correct for overall skew and scale, but cannot fix non-linear distortions within the map.

2. **Coastlines have changed** since 1750 due to landfill, erosion, and development (especially in the South Bronx). The modern shoreline may not exactly match the 1750 shoreline.

3. **The Harlem River Ship Canal** was cut through in 1895, changing the course at Marble Hill. The 1750 map shows the original Spuyten Duyvil Creek, which followed a different path.

4. **River courses have shifted** slightly over 275 years, especially the Bronx River, which was heavily modified in the 19th and 20th centuries.

5. **Best-fit approach:** Prioritize aligning the large, stable geographic features (peninsula tips, river mouths) over trying to match every coastline detail. The peninsulas and river confluences have moved the least.
